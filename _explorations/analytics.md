From my analytics data, I can see that my website has had five users in total. The amount of views my website reigned peaked on February 19th, where three users viewed my website. Average engagement time of my website was 5 seconds, which is a very poor number and means I must make my website more engaging for users to view it for a longer period of time. It shows I had 1 viewer in the last 30 minutes, which is a great way of analyzing viewer increase/decrease in short moments after a change is implemented to the site. It also says each viewer was from the United States, which allows me to narrow down my target audience to cater to. Each user viewed my website through a direct link to it, so perhaps there are other methods I can partake in to gain viewers from other webpages or other sources in general.
