I will be reviewing Liz’s Cafe, founded by Elizabeth. Unfortunately, viewing the main page of the website, there aren’t any pictures to particularly draw me into visiting this cafe. However, I enjoy the fact that the page describes the cafe’s goals and core ideals of having friendly staff, inclusive menu options, local goods, and a relaxing atmosphere. This is important for reaching the target audience right off the bat, as the cafe will draw in customers looking for these values while they dine in at restaurants. The “Where we Source” section is very unique and makes this cafe stand out from the others; it provides direct links to where the goods provided in the cafe come from, allowing viewers to see exactly how authentic the cafe is, and commemorate the cafe for supporting local businesses rather than corporations. The hours are clear and concise, providing the same times each and every day so customers aren’t confused at all when the shop is open. The reviews are unfortunately lacking, so I would recommend editing that section to provide outside viewpoints of the cafe. There is an email provided for contact information, but I would also recommend providing a cell phone number that prompts a more immediate answer from the cafe rather than the customer having to wait for an email in return. There is one menu item, a “chocolate croissant”, but there isn’t a particular description of the menu item, what it includes, and where the ingredients come from, which are things I would suggest adding for extra appeal to customers.
