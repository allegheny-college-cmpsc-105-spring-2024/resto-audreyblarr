I will be reviewing Cafe Cocca, founded by Celia. First and foremost, a target audience is established as anybody who loves coffee, teas, or caffeine in general. The picture provided of the restaurant scenery and seating is very enticing and makes me want to visit, as the decor is very beautiful and cozy. Then, the website goes on to highlight the main values that set it apart from the other many coffee shops, including providing both indoor and outdoor seating, and serving their beverages and food items in hand-made, ceramic mugs and plates. This creates a sense of authenticity in the shop that separates it from places like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts that aren’t as personable as Cafe Cocca is. A link to their Instagram page is provided for further exploration of the coffee shop and to possibly answer any questions readers may have that haven’t been answered already. The hours are listed on the main page which is very convenient for quick access. Important information about location, contact information, hours, and other resources fits perfectly under the “Contact us!” section of the website for easy access of the user. The menu is very thorough, exceeding the requirement of including just one menu item by including several, some being the cafe beverages such as the several types of coffees and teas, and some being cafe entrees including a breakfast sandwich and burrito. I would love to check out this cafe, it seems very comforting and cozy and it’s refreshing to see the owner and employees working to create a personalized experience for each customer!
